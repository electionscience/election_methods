# Election Data

Consolidated State, Local and Federal election data across the USA

## Goals

- A unified dataset for all elections across the USA
- A simple tool to query that data to ask questions such as "all elections where the winners have won with fewer than 50% of the vote"

## Tasks/Tools

Python

- Pandas
- DataTable ?
- Jupyter?

Scraping
Maybe an instance of CKAN for archiving the data? Probably best to store links/CSVs in the repo for now.
Do we need a database/backend?
What does our standardized format look like?

## Importing

Identify and download source
Create parser python script to convert to our standardized format
